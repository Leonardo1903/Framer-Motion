# Tailwind CSS Basics

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to build modern, responsive user interfaces. Instead of writing custom CSS, you use utility classes directly in your HTML or JSX.

## Why Use Tailwind CSS?

- **Rapid Development:** Build layouts quickly with pre-defined classes.
- **Customizable:** Easily extend or override the default theme.
- **Responsive Design:** Built-in support for responsive breakpoints.
- **No Naming Hassles:** No need to come up with unique class names.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Tailwind CSS:**
   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

2. **Configure `tailwind.config.js`:**
   ```js
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```

3. **Add Tailwind to your CSS:**
   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

## Example Usage

```jsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

This button uses Tailwind classes for background color, text color, padding, and rounded corners.

## Conclusion

Tailwind CSS streamlines the process of building beautiful, responsive websites. By using utility classes, you can focus on building your UI without writing custom CSS for every component.
